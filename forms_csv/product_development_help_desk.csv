Our unique value is closing the loop between diagnostics and action: users receive a personalized protocol (nutrition, training, recovery rituals, and supplement stacks), ongoing monitoring with week-by-week adjustments, and a repeatable re-test pathway. We focus on cardiovascular and metabolic risk reduction as the “core engine,” then extend into brain/stress and recovery modules. The experience is designed for mainstream consumers: fast, explainable, and measurable—without requiring a full clinic workflow.",,N/A,https://acuityscheduling-client-assets-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9959aff33a447428c7ecfc9db62f5ae8-photo_2026-01-30%2013.02.19.jpeg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEPv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIE2cymUOVL%2FJaTw1sR02Vd%2BH5VAq4ax9QsnUJgxCfwrGAiEAvTiwuzDDeiBRZXXcwqVfXe2drCFSdK8TWkmBKuvXrK0qmgQIxP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAEGgw2MzYyNjc3MTM5NzEiDGP4RAXqhUoSm%2FOiziruA203qVq49oWurrI9eOAPbZTpNlblgMF7eWdWx%2FMVv9UYtCuwnMogHiR%2BJNbhOU3K%2BAn6MtiJYz3LaJhK1v3fqEgEQF4NL%2FOleBuYeKbs3XyFOdAMXN%2BvH5RaQJn6hoxm%2FmyIACubp70i2yn8PwznvX7sDhoISMSICoHdY3tsyDI9POf5Nz9%2BNM18erd94KWUQzlZC6ARnKQlI5hWmLxPMZ%2B%2BE8KzofdHK%2BJ8feo4m3dqdzD4AjA%2B9NhWCwiTpjEjkv%2Bewocem8iyBDbzmkELrJ%2BUOtzVDbx1pOZuhnhES3yDNEczWZUjKrRfNsD90AFsKm39YW1ojLTkZEqYvOMvrKW4hjBZf8vs%2BWQt8xhK4jnQDvAXYntKCuxQpwaLSKbmkyyyD%2BYBJuhsFijkTXACnwFLzMyAFbrJ78P4sFrzMUFeW7xnsBmuRikGoiMwk7cICJJ5jJMHnzkkHQluMHeVKYG%2BwQsXidKrgEdPfe2mrKHHw3UStVlrRX1QVqVoGCQB0NoLMSpmBlkxKPjvWEcqzH6%2FyI3wI3o35H2Gp%2F%2BSPc65yceIM3Yn412wcowuQkQkSTWwMJB%2BP27GBi54MA%2BOAjvkDLKE2kgxsgJGIgI54pAaxkpG75KNdwzWCDccioX21MR%2FmNv4OOq3gQyZ8m25MPvy%2BssGOqYB9%2FCRzJ6rhJStRfTV7apX9FY4GzKOG2zceVg6l8zTKlQNRWKc2oBRn6ZBhAunq57kTOgNY6yXD6RzSyt6bXe7XJ3rsKvyo7%2B0HDKxrq%2BH52HrkwIlWhFhDxjgEvgdFIFxPpD0KGA%2Ba%2BohdvR8ItpyWKcAd8xMl0iSLsfojv69aKo6IG5mP%2BavatJYrw8GaXKsASj3%2BKz21Ggep6Ym5oh1TH8Lg%2BHlig%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZIJEC2WZYEGUWJLY%2F20260201%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20260201T022647Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=c696b1cd44697b8d0c5194a8d9598ad6974f86cfe4b08038ff2adbb04104e10f,-,yes,"Sadulla - student/NYUSH/neuroscience/2027

How we’re differentiated

Hybrid model, not “lab-only” or “wearable-only”: we combine fast offline screenings + wearables + biomarkers into one longitudinal profile.

Action engine + repeat testing: we don’t stop at “insights”—we generate structured protocols and optimize them against measurable outcomes (PWV, HRV, morning BP, sleep quality, metabolic markers).

Affordable + scalable distribution: we aim to deliver screening and onboarding via pharmacies/retail wellness corners and partner locations, not only high-end clinics.

Explainable personalization: our recommendations are tied to a clear mechanvism and a measurable metric (e.g., arterial stiffness phenotype → interventions → expected PWV delta over 8–12 weeks)."
